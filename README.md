I am Ram, a Year 2 Information Security student from the National University of Singapore.

I am starting out in the world of developing applications, which teaches me more than watching tutorials.

My current tech stack is React Native and TypeScript.

My aim is to build 3 applications by the end of the year.

Occasionally, I take part in Capture-the-Flag competitions, so I will document my findings here.
